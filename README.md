# Haloed Lines with WebGL

Implementation of the haloed-lines-algorithm by Arthur Appel et al. (1979) using WebGL, JavaScript and HTML5.

The haloed-line-algorithm is a method in computer graphics to represent three-dimensional objects. The drawn lines are enhanced by an invisible outline, the halo, which covers lines in the back and therefore emphasizes the effects of three-dimensionality.
